# AhAhAh-Sample-Theme

This is a sample theme for the Ah!Ah!Ah! tweak. It also comes with an example project ready to be built into a deb file for distribution on Cydia.


###  Creating a Theme

A theme is a folder containing three elements: an Info.plist file, a video or image, and a thumbnail.

The name of the folder is the name of the theme.

```
My First Theme
 |- Info.plist
 |- MyVideo.m4v
 |- Thumbnail.png
```

Themes must be installed to this location:
```
/User/Library/AhAhAh/Themes/
```
